const s=`# Lesson 7: Classical ML

## Summary
- Implement random forests/regression and compare with DL baselines for suitable tasks.

## Key Points
- Feature preprocessing and simple baselines are powerful.
- Evaluate with task‑appropriate metrics and cross‑validation when needed.
- Use classical ML to sanity‑check DL choices.

## Tasks
- Train a random forest/regression baseline.
- Compare metrics with DL models on the same split.
- Discuss where classical ML may be preferable.

## Resources
- scikit‑learn datasets \`https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html\`
- fastai tabular/classical ML interop (use pandas/sklearn as needed)
